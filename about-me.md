subtitle: Giving this RV thing a try.

If your experience was anything like mine, you expected to get your initiation into the RV life from your RV dealer or manufacturer. I made sure to tell my salesman that I was completely new to this, and that I would take any and all advice he would give me. I figured he would spend some extra time on the things I needed to know. Instead, all I got was a 20 minute "walk through" by a guy missing a few teeth, and a generic owners manual that was the same for every model of RV sold by the manufacturer.

For a first-timer, getting out in an RV requires a steep learning curve. My goal is to help you get to the top of the curve as painlessly as possible.
