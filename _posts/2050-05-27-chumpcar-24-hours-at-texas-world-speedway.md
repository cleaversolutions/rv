Friday was supposed to be an easy day for us, but we found out Thursday night that our battery wasn't holding a charge. We bought a new alternator and battery both, only to find out that when we re-wired the gauges on our car for this race that we weren't exciting the alternator. And we didn't know what that meant. We're pretty clueless when electronics are concerned and our mechanic wasn't going to be at the track until Saturday morning.

So, we were reading manuals and internet articles trying to figure out what to do when, lo and behold, I looked up and saw a friend of ours we've known for 20 years who owns his own car repair shop. He had us a manual switch wired within an hour. Many thanks to Thom Martin for that, and for volunteering to be a ChumpCar pit road official during the 8pm to 4am shift.

We got out for about an hour of practice, came in for the day, and realized our right-front wheel bearing was bad. So we made a run for a new hub assembly and got it put in Saturday morning.

I started the race in the car and was the first car to take the green flag (a first!). I was taking it easy when two miatas blew by me in turn one. I realized I was going to have to step it up to keep pace. Two laps in I got black flagged. Our new transponder we bought wasn't working. We checked the number, I went back out, and they had the number right. So I came in a second time and we changed our transponder for a rental. With that snafu, we realized that competing for the win would require some attrition, so we just ran our race and strategy and would see how high we could climb.

Our car and drivers did great, and our pit strategy seemed to allow us to make up a lap or two on the leaders for a while, but it wasn't at a fast enough pace to overcome the early deficit. We ran most of the night in 6th place (excluding the City Garage EC car), even though our pace was a bit slower than we had hoped. We saved our fastest drivers for the night, but our headlights weren't quite good enough to allow them to turn the same lap times as during daylight. And when the leaders were turning 2:06s at night, that hurt. We were just hoping to crack the top 5.

Then came the driver change for the 6am-8am shift. I went to get gas for the next pit stop, came back to our pit, and heard they had our car being towed back on a rollback.

When we looked at the damage when the car got back to the garage, we decided we might be able to fix it and get it back on track by the end of the race, but we all decided that we'd rather just pack it up and go home. Our driver had an off in turn three and hit one of the curbs in the cutoff between turns three and ten dead-on with the oil pan. It wasn't cracked, it was shattered. The front cross-member that held the radiator was bent way back, too. And we're not sure if anything in the suspension was knocked way out. So we packed up and headed home.

For the next race, I'd like to get our lighting better and figure out how in the world we were wearing our left side tires more than our right side.

Congrats to the guys who finished on the podium. We had hoped to give you all a run for the money, but it seems like you had us covered this race.

Thanks to ChumpCar and all the volunteers for letting us live a dream. Growing up, my bucket list had "Attend a 24 hour race" at some point in my life. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I would compete in one.

Below is our fast lap of the race:
