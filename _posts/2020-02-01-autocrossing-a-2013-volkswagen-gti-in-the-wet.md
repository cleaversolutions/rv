Since buying my car two months ago, I've been really impressed with how great of a daily driver it is. The interior feels upscale, the engine has a wide torque curve, the suspension is well damped for normal and spirited driving, and it gets great gas mileage. But I wanted to see how it would do when it was really pushed to the limit, so I entered it into the North Texas Autocross Series' Winter Event.

In summary: *understeer*.

### Morning

When I rolled out of the garage at 7:00am Saturday I noticed it was misting, but the weather called for it to go away by early morning, so I expected to get in my runs on a mostly dry track. Incorrect. It misted all morning, which meant that my morning runs were done on a very damp autocross circuit, which made the car's worst handling feature even more pronounced.

As far as the types of circuits this car is suited to, it probably looks something like this:
Dry Road Course &gt; Wet Road Course &gt; Dry Autocross Course &gt; Wet Autocross Course &gt; Ice Racing

While I've never had this car on a road course, I've done a lot of reading about it and it seems that the car actually handles pretty well on big road courses. With their wide radius corners, higher speeds, and only 200 hp on tap, the GTI actually doesn't have as much of a problem with terminal understeer on these types of courses.

A wet autocross, on the other hand, has nothing but quick transitions, tight radius corners, and tiny straights where you are trying to get the power down as soon and hard as possible. All of this meant that breathing on the accelerator during my wet autocross runs resulted in plow-like power-on understeer. The car wanted to do one of two things: accelerate or turn, but in no way did it even attempt to do both at the same time. The only thing worse would have been to be driving on ice.

Since I didn't want to just coast in neutral through the whole course, that meant I was fighting understeer for probably 75% or more of my runs. And it put me constantly behind in my turn in points. I would miss my lines because I was over driving and the car would understeer away from my intended line. In the morning while the course was still wet I could not force myself to slow down enough to actually get the car to behave the way I want it to. Since this was my first time autocrossing a front wheel drive car, ever, I'm sure it didn't help being wet. In the future, I think I'll be better able to adjust my driving style to the car, but today it was not happening.

Here is a video of my best morning run, and you can see how I'm not on the correct line in many of the corners:

### Afternoon

In the afternoon, the course was reversed and it had dried out some. This made the power-on understeer less pronounced, but it was still pretty bad. I did move up five places in the standings in the afternoon versus my morning runs, which tells me that the car's worst tendencies start to disappear as more grip becomes available.

Here's a video of my best afternoon run:

### Summary

I'm not sure I'll ever do another autocross in this car again. I don't really want to do a lot of modifications to it, and in stock configuration this car just is not well-suited to this kind of driving. It's <em>almost</em> not even fun, especially in the wet.

That's not to say this isn't a great car. I did hours and hours of research and test drives before finally deciding on the GTI as my daily driver and that is what is excels at.
