title: 20 Things You Must Have for Your Camper
---

We've made a few trips with our camper, and it's crazy the amount of stuff that you need that *doesn't* come with your camper. Here's a list of the essentials (i.e. don't even think about going camping without it).

I ordered almost everything off of Amazon, but I was surprised to find out that Walmart carries a lot of these RV supplies. So if you are in a pinch for an impending trip, check your local Walmart.

### Essentials - Don't Go Camping Without These Things

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/310H50qPoSL._SX500_.jpg">
[**Weight Distribution Hitch**](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006X21B0M/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - Maybe you have a huge truck you are using to pull a tiny camper, but for most people, getting a weight distribution hitch is a must. I have pulled my camper with and without one, and they make a huge difference in the comfort of towing a camper. I chose an Andersen hitch, and will hopefully have a post coming soon about why I chose it and am happy with my decision.

[**Leveler**](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001GC2LVM/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - I was a bit confused about this at first, but then I learned: camp sites are not level! It's easy to level your camper front-to-back using the tongue jack, but side-to-side requires lifting up one of the wheels. There are a lot of different styles out there, but I like this one. Just place this under the wheel you want to raise, and back up until it's level. It will raise up to 4 inches. If you need more than that, go find a different camp site. Get two if you have a double axle trailer.

[Jack Pads](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B005BNZ9UM/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - You may not *have* to have these for your first outing, but some camp sites require you to use pads underneath your jacks. They are handy and are good to have regardless. Put these under each stabilizing jack. This is linked to a 2-pack. Make sure you get enough.

[Wheel Chocks](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00K1C1WC2/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - Unless you want your camper to roll when it's not hooked up to your tow vehicle, you must have wheel chocks. These are pretty small chocks. You may want to get a bigger set depending on your trailer size. And if you regularly park on serious slopes, the rubber kind are better to have.

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41vUUP5yq5L.jpg">
[EMS](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003AL23TC/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - Some people call this a "surge protector," and I guess as long as you buy it and use it, that's fine. But that's not what this is. This is an "Electronic Management System." Yes, it does function as a surge protector, but in my research that's not where it helps people. An EMS will run all sorts of tests on the electricity that you have running to your camper, and the main problem people have reported at campsites is **low voltage**. A surge protector doesn't protect against low voltage, but an EMS does. Low voltage can ruin the high dollar components in your camper, such as the air conditioner. If the EMS detects low voltage, it cuts off the power to your trailer and displays an error code alerting you to the problem. Way more people have reported their EMS saving them from low voltage than saving them from a power surge. I won't plug in my RV without one.

The one in the picture is the one I got, and it is portable and simple. You just plug it into the post and then plug your camper into the EMS. However, if I had to do it all over again, I think I would get [the kind that can be wired inside of the trailer](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004A32CGI/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20). That way it is secure inside the camper and it's one less thing to plug in when I need power to the camper. However, if you don't want to pay to get one wired (if you can't do it yourself) or you need one ASAP, the portable one works just as well.

[Water pressure regulator](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003BZD08U/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - The plumbing fittings in most RVs aren't built to withstand more than about 50 PSI, and there are plenty of places that will have water pressure higher than that. Adding a water pressure regulator to the inlet of your RV will make sure you don't have water leaking from all over the insides of your camper.

[Fresh water hose](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004VHXS20/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - I'm not sure it really matters, but I made sure to get a hose specifically rated for fresh water drinking. Generally speaking, RVers universally recognize white or blue hoses as fresh (potable) water hoses, so get something that color, at least.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

[90 Degree water elbow](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003BZD03K/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - Apparently the plastic inlet where you hook up your camper to your fresh water hose is prone to breaking. This 90 degree elbow helps relieve some of the force on that fitting. 

<div class="clearfix"></div>

[Sewer hose](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01HPHR2M4/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - The whole reason we got a camper was so we didn't have to share a bathroom with the plebs, right? Well, that means if you are going to use your bathroom, you've got to dump it. My dealer gave me a *complimentary* sewer hose. When I looked at it, I knew it wasn't going to do the job. I think it was made for lawn irrigation. So I got this Camco Rhino sewer hose and it's worked great so far.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717dM9kAfnL._SL500_.jpg">
[Clear sewer elbow](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B006OQ35GU/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - I didn't think this was an "essential," but I bought one before our first trip, and I'm *so* glad I did. I couldn't believe how long and how many rinses it took to get the black tank to run clear, but I would have *significantly* underestimated it if I didn't have a clear sewer elbow. With a clear elbow, you rinse the black tank until... stuff... stops coming out. Without a clear elbow, you're just guessing (and probably leaving lots of poo in your camper). I got the 45 degree elbow, but I think a [straight adapter like this one](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B016V2JMBS/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) would be better.

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811xWO5RpnL._SL500_.jpg">
[Toilet Treatment](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00157TGXY/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - Some kind of deodorizer and "waste digester" helps to break things down for easy dumping and prevent stink. With these, we haven't had any trouble, yet. 

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81jLGdob31L._SL500_.jpg">
[Black tank rinse hose](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B06XGW1NGD/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - You need a separate hose to rinse your blank tank because, well, I shouldn't really have to tell you why. I like that this one has a nice thick fitting on the end that makes it easy to turn and tighten by (gloved) hand.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lpzskQycL._SX500_.jpg">
[Latex gloves](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00192JH4S/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - I'm not dumping the black tank bare-handed. If you want to, go for it.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51V8%2BKtrJKL._SL500_.jpg">
[Lug wrench](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000CMJ2KU/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - So, get this. My camper has *different* sized lug nuts than my tow vehicle, and both of those have *different* sized nuts than those holding on the spare tire. So, I need three different sizes to change a tire on the road. Thankfully, I found this lug wrench with all four standard lug sizes (two sockets each with two different sizes), and it is extendable out to 21 inches. That's longer than most X-style 4-lug wrenches, which means it will be easier to break those lugs loose with the extra torque provided by the longer handle. It collapses down small enough to fit in my little camper toolbox.

[Jack & Blocks](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DGXVVHE/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - I wasn't sure my tow vehicle's jack would be the best option for changing a flat tire, so I got a bottle jack for the camper. **You will probably need a block to put your jack on.** My frame rails sit about 14 inches off the ground, and most jacks won't raise up tall enough by themselves. Make sure you have blocks to put underneath your jack if you need to change a trailer tire.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51i3iQtXYmL.jpg">
[Tongue Jack Block](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01M1MXQBL/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - This might not be an essential item, but if you don't have one and need it, it will be too late. I got these after our second camping trip when I had to extend our trailer tongue jack almost all the way to get the trailer level. Much more and I would have been out of luck. With these blocks, I get an extra 14 inches of height if I need it. I can also use these under the bottle jack to change a flat, I think. You can also do it the old fashioned way and just get some plain wood blocks.

[Air pressure guage](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0037V0EW8/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - You already have one of these for your tow vehicle anyways, right?

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1qEK20Az3L._SX522_.jpg">
[First Aid Kit](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CYBXLA4/ref=nosim&tag=mattclecom-20) - Again, you already have one of these for your tow vehicle anyways, right?
