<p><strong>MSR Houston, 24 Hours of Lemons Yee-Haw It's Lemons 2011</strong></p>
<p>This was one of the best weekends of racing we'd ever had...</p>
<p>Until noon on Sunday.</p>
<p>Friday was the normal stuff: a little practice, go over strategy, get ready for the race. We had a new driver with us, Mike, who acclimated to the car quickly and looked like a great addition to the team.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, we were leading the race on Saturday afternoon. Things were going really well and we started thinking "This might be the race" until we had a dad-blame weld break on a our coil mount, which caused the coil &amp; wires to fall onto the exhaust manifold and get ruined. Dan pulled into the pits, and we didn't have a spare coil. We ran over to the nearest e30 we could find to see if they had one, and... they did! We didn't lose any more than 10 minutes thanks to Brian, our expert mechanic. I'm not sure how far down the standings we fell, but I'm pretty sure we still finished the day in the top-5.</p>

<p>Sunday we were just going to run our race and see what kind of finish we could salvage. Everything was going to plan until we got a mystery black flag at noon on Sunday. I radioed to Mike to see if he had gone off track or hit anyone, and he said he hadn't. We were both confused about what was going on.</p>
<p>As he came into the pits, he track official told him we had been awarded The People's Curse.</p>

<p>In the good ol' days of Lemons racing, that meant that they took your car and used a backhoe or some other scary machine to completely destroy your car. Thankfully for us the rules had evolved over the years so that the severity of the Curse was based on how many people voted for your car. A ton of votes and you get crushed, less votes and you get some damage, and less votes you get your time wasted. Apparently we fell into the least-severe category. They rammed our door a bit with a fork lift and made us decorate the car in Halloween stuff. We lost about 30 minutes during the Curse.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that deflated the team. We finished out the race, but we were all a bit dazed (okay, some of us were angry, but that's just a function of the racer's "red mist"). We still finished 6th out of 59 cars, 25 laps behind the leader, but our weekend was definitely soured by the dreaded Curse.</p>
<p>Here's our fast lap of the race, the fastest our car has ever gone at this track. Drew was driving on Sunday morning, when the track was in perfect shape: cool and sunny. It ended up being the third fastest lap of the race. Most of the other laps everyone turned were 3-4 seconds slower, so this lap came out of virtually nowhere.</p>

<p>For those wondering <em>why</em> we got the People's Curse, here are a few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Curse" was fairly mild, meaning we didn't get a lot of votes. Jay did say we got the most. Fair enough, some of our peers didn't like something about us.</li>
<li>On the other hand, there were many people in the pits surprised to see us called in for the Curse. They said that we weren't even close to being on their "short list."</li>
<li>After we had the coil mount break, we came out of the pits just in front of the leader. I radioed our driver to be smart, but to see if he could stay in front of the leader and not go another lap down. This is our most experienced driver, who has been racing something since the 1970s. Normally I have a target lap time that I don't want our drivers to go under, but during this stint I just let him push the car as hard a he could to stay ahead of one of those god-forsaken-why-are-they-so-fast SHOs.</li>
<li>He was pushing hard, but I was the spotter during the whole stint. If our drivers start to get aggressive or do something silly, I tell them to back off, and I never did. Because then it was too late...</li>
<li>While trying to get around traffic, our driver tried to pass someone on the outside of a tight corner, and put our car off the track. There was no contact. As happens in Lemons, we got a black flag for that.</li>
<li>Someone posted on the Lemons forum that we got the Curse for off-track behavior as much as on-track behavior, but wouldn't say what that meant.</li>
</ul>
